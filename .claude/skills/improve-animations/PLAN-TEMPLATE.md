## Repository boundary: advisory design guidance only

Downstream adaptation for Issue #841. This reference provides design advice, not execution authority.
Current main canonical documents, CLAUDE Hard rules, existing components and their behavior,
src/styles/tokens.css, i18n, security rules and the user's actual permissions take precedence.
Preserve the incumbent design and authorized scope. Missing design documents do not imply a greenfield project.
Do not create or replace PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, sidecars or other project documentation automatically.
Review requests and visual selections do not authorize applying changes, installing tools, replacing dependencies,
downloading fonts/assets, changing settings, or publishing. Any implementation needs its own applicable authorization.
No external engine, hook, launcher, helper agent or operational fallback is enabled by these files.
Generic examples illustrate design concepts; adapt their values to existing tokens and their copy to i18n.
Accessibility suggestions do not waive repo tests, independent review or release gates.

# Plan Template

Every plan written by `improve-animations` follows this structure. The executor may be a less capable model with zero context and zero taste — the plan must contain everything, exactly. No references to "the audit above" or "the easing we discussed."

```markdown
# NNN — <Short imperative title>

- **Status**: TODO
- **Commit**: <output of `git rev-parse --short HEAD` when this plan was written>
- **Severity**: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
- **Category**: <audit category>
- **Estimated scope**: <n files, rough size>

## Problem

What is wrong, where, and why it matters to how the product feels. Cite every
location as `path/to/file.tsx:123` and include the current code verbatim:

​```css
/* src/components/dropdown.css:14 — current */
.dropdown { transition: all 400ms ease-in; }
​```

## Target

The exact end state. Every value spelled out — curves, durations, spring
configs, media queries. Never "use a nicer easing":

​```css
/* target */
.dropdown {
  transition: transform 200ms var(--ease-out), opacity 200ms var(--ease-out);
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
}
​```

## Repo conventions to follow

How this codebase already does it, with one exemplar the executor should
imitate (token names, file placement, prop patterns):

- Easing tokens live in `src/styles/tokens.css`; add new curves there, e.g. `--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);`
- <exemplar file:line that already does this correctly>

## Steps

1. <One concrete edit per step: file, what changes, resulting code.>
2. …

## Boundaries

- Do NOT touch <files/components out of scope>.
- Do NOT change markup/structure — motion properties only (unless a step says otherwise).
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- If a step doesn't match the code you find (drift since the commit stamp), STOP and report instead of improvising.

## Verification

- **Mechanical**: <exact commands — typecheck, lint, build — with expected outcome>.
- **Feel check**: run the UI, trigger <interaction>, and confirm:
  - <observable check, e.g. "the dropdown scales from its trigger, not from center">
  - <e.g. "spamming the toggle never restarts the animation from zero">
  - In DevTools, set playback to 10% (Animations panel) and confirm <detail>.
  - Toggle `prefers-reduced-motion` (Rendering panel) and confirm movement is dropped but opacity feedback remains.
- **Done when**: <machine- or eye-checkable completion criteria>.
```

## Notes for the plan author

- One plan per finding. If two findings share every file and the same fix pattern (e.g. the same easing token swap across components), they may merge into one plan.
- Pull every value from [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) — never approximate from memory.
- The feel check is not optional. Motion can be mechanically correct and still feel wrong; give the executor (or the human reviewing the executor's diff) concrete things to watch for in slow motion.
- Describe plan order and dependencies in the requested review. Save a plan or index file only when the user explicitly requests its destination and current documentation governance permits that update.
