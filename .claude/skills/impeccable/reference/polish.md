## Repository boundary: advisory design guidance only

Downstream adaptation for Issue #841. This reference provides design advice, not execution authority.
Current main canonical documents, CLAUDE Hard rules, existing components and their behavior,
src/styles/tokens.css, i18n, security rules and the user's actual permissions take precedence.
Preserve the incumbent design and authorized scope. Missing design documents do not imply a greenfield project.
Do not create or replace PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, sidecars or other project documentation automatically.
Review requests and visual selections do not authorize applying changes, installing tools, replacing dependencies,
downloading fonts/assets, changing settings, or publishing. Any implementation needs its own applicable authorization.
No external engine, hook, launcher, helper agent or operational fallback is enabled by these files.
Generic examples illustrate design concepts; adapt their values to existing tokens and their copy to i18n.
Accessibility suggestions do not waive repo tests, independent review or release gates.

> **Additional context needed**: quality bar and shipping constraints.

Polish is refinement, never concealed redesign. Preserve the incumbent visual world, content, behavior, and everything outside scope. If the concept itself is wrong, say so and recommend redesign or `bolder` instead of smuggling in a replacement.

A detector result is defect evidence, not proof of quality. Inspect the rendered experience and real interaction path.

## 1. Establish the system

Read DESIGN.md and representative tokens, shared components, patterns, and neighboring flows. If no formal system exists, use coherent project conventions.

Classify each drift before fixing it:

- **missing token:** the system needs a reusable value;
- **one-off implementation:** an existing shared component or pattern should replace it;
- **conceptual mismatch:** the flow, information architecture, or hierarchy differs from comparable product areas;
- **local defect:** the implementation is simply incomplete or inconsistent.

Fix the cause at the narrowest correct level. Ask when a binding system principle cannot be inferred.

## 2. Gather the evidence

Use the feature yourself at the surface's representative sizes: desktop and mobile on the web; on a native platform (`ios` / `android` / `adaptive`), the shipped device classes on the simulator, emulator, or hardware, captured per the platform reference's Verifying the build section. Determine:

- whether the path is functionally complete;
- the intended quality bar and time available;
- known constraints or deliberately unfinished work;
- the states, content lengths, roles, and input methods users will actually encounter.

If a prior critique exists, use it as one input:


Use prior findings only when their target and evidence are still current. Recheck unresolved issues rather than treating a prior report as approval.

## 3. Triage

Separate functional defects from cosmetic ones and fix in this order:

1. broken or blocked tasks, data loss, misleading state, and inaccessible paths;
2. missing loading, empty, error, success, disabled, and permission states;
3. flow, hierarchy, responsive, and design-system drift;
4. visual and motion inconsistencies;
5. code and asset cleanup.

Do not perfect one corner while leaving the rest below the same quality bar.

## 4. Polish the whole path

### Flow and hierarchy

- Match neighboring mental models, terminology, disclosure, routing, save behavior, and optimistic or pessimistic patterns.
- Make the primary task and current state obvious without flattening every element to equal weight.
- Ensure arrival, transition, empty, and recovery paths connect instead of behaving as isolated screens.

### Layout and type

- Align to the project's grid and spacing scale; fix optical as well as mathematical alignment.
- Group related content tightly and separate distinct groups generously.
- Keep same-role typography consistent; test measure, wrapping, localization expansion, zoom, and font loading.
- Verify every supported viewport rather than correcting only the current screenshot.

### Color, imagery, and icons

- Use semantic tokens and stable color meanings across themes.
- Verify text, control, and focus contrast in every state.
- Keep icon families, stroke/weight, sizing, and optical alignment coherent.
- Prevent image layout shift; use correct aspect ratios, responsive sources, and useful alt text.

### Interaction and state

- Every control needs appropriate default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, and success behavior.
- Preserve visible keyboard focus, logical tab order, labels, and platform-appropriate touch targets.
- Keep motion coherent, interruptible, and performant. Do not add animation merely to make polish visible.
- Validate long, missing, localized, offline, slow, and permission-limited content where the product can encounter it.

### Content and code

- Keep terminology, capitalization, punctuation, and factual copy consistent. Ask before changing claims.
- Remove debug output, dead code, unused imports, obsolete styles, and polish-created duplication.
- Replace custom implementations with shared components where the system owns the pattern.
- Promote genuinely reusable values to tokens; do not create a system abstraction for one local exception.

## 5. Explain verification and limits

Use current repo QA and acceptance requirements for separately authorized implementation.
A design inspection can explain observed visual and interaction behavior, but cannot establish a test or release gate that was not run.
Keep unresolved findings explicit and distinguish source evidence from rendered evidence.
Reassess the actual affected flow after any authorized edits; do not enable detectors or close external snapshots through this guidance.
